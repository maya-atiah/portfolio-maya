      <h1>about <span>Myself</span></h1>
      <h3>I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with expertise in modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Next.js, Laravel, and Node.js. My journey began at Codi Tech, an intensive web development bootcamp, where I honed my technical and soft skills. I mastered new programming languages, collaborative teamwork, project management, and the AGILE methodology, which I apply to every project.

        Currently, at CTS, I focus on frontend development, leveraging tools like Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and React Query to create responsive, user-friendly web applications. I have contributed to diverse projects, including CRMs, CMSs, and university portals, while refining my ability to integrate APIs and deliver optimized, scalable solutions. Additionally, I have a keen interest in wireframe design and application architecture, which helps me build intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.
